## `r fontawesome::fa("chart-line", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Step 2. What visualization type?

*Next, decide what visualization type(s) is most appropriate given your data type(s).*

From [Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) (in my opinion) the *best* place to start when answering this question -- use the decision tree to explore chart options based on your data type(s).

## Click on a particular chart type in the [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) decision tree to find:

- a definition and examples(s)
- a description of what that chart type is used for
- common variations on that chart type
- common mistakes (and how to avoid them)
- related chart types (i.e. others that you might also consider using for your given data type(s))
- links to the [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) and [Python gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/) with *many* different examples of that chart type + code so that you can learn how to create your own

**This is seriously such an invaluable resource, and I highly recommend turning to it often!!!**

## **`r fontawesome::fa("temperature-quarter", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Example 1:** Ocean Temperatures

We're presented with a few great options (boxplot, violin plot, ridgeline plot, density plot, histogram) given our data. I'm partial to the **ridgeline plot** -- I find it an intuitive way to view changes in temperature distributions through time, so that's what I'll choose for this example:
