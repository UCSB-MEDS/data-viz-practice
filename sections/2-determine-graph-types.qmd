## `r fontawesome::fa("chart-line", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Step 2. What visualization type?

*Next, decide what visualization type(s) is most appropriate given your data type(s).*

From [Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) (in my opinion) the *best* place to start when answering this question -- use the decision tree to explore chart options based on your data type(s).

## Click on a particular chart type in the [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) decision tree to find:

- a definition and examples(s)
- a description of what that chart type is used for
- common variations on that chart type
- common mistakes (and how to avoid them)
- related chart types (i.e. others that you might also consider using for your given data type(s))
- links to the [R graph gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html) and [Python gallery](https://www.python-graph-gallery.com/) with *many* different examples of that chart type + code so that you can learn how to create your own

**This is seriously such an invaluable resource, and I highly recommend turning to it often!!!**

## **`r fontawesome::fa("temperature-quarter", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Ex 1:** Ocean Temperatures

We're presented with a few great options (boxplot, violin plot, ridgeline plot, density plot, histogram) given our data. I'm partial to the **ridgeline plot** -- I find it an intuitive way to view changes in temperature distributions through time, so that's what I'll choose for this example:

## **`r fontawesome::fa("tree-city", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Ex 2:** Urban Trees

## **`r fontawesome::fa("sun", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Ex 3:** CA Drought

Weâ€™re presented with a few options (line plot, stacked area chart, streamgraph) given our data. **Stacked area plots** are useful for displaying the evolution of the value of several groups on the same graphic (in our case, the evolution of `perc_area` for each `condition` group), so that's what I'll choose for this example:

::: callout-important
## Stacked area plots should be used with caution.
They are appropriate for studying the evolution of the whole (e.g. all drought categories through time) and the relative proportions of each group, but *not* for studying the evolution of each group -- it's very difficult to subtract the height of other groups at any given time point to calculate the value for a group of interest.
