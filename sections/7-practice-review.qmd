## **`r fontawesome::fa("laptop-code", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")`** How do I get better / gain confidence in creating data visualizations?

Creating beautiful and effective data visualizations is a skill that gets better with practice -- give [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) a whirl, enter a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions), take a deep dive into aRtistry (check out [Ijeamaka Anyene's](https://ijeamaka-anyene.netlify.app/) amazing talk on creating radial visualizations with `ggplot2` - [slides](https://ijeamakaanyene.github.io/aRt_ggplot/index.html#1) & [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0i6KAahLY8&ab_channel=R-LadiesGlobal)), or simply start playing around with data that means something to you.

## **`r fontawesome::fa("book-open-reader", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")`** Review & Resources

Take a look back at [Allison Horst's](https://allisonhorst.github.io/) data viz lectures and labs from EDS 221 for a `{ggplot2}` review, practice, and a reminder about important considerations for making responsible data visualizations:

- [**Lecture 15:** The (layered) grammar of graphics & data viz considerations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSpUdai7BTXprh3dwSNBpJymNGUIOFhEgQn5XbQWZhWy8EpUyd64Lem08YK_kc6tP0iyoJ5wRAVvSYe/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p)
-[**Lecture 16:** Data exploration and visualization continued](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR1QB0S3AfBfdJZ1nnhUw2iKSxV83GDc5l9BYPC6yQhxBdnzRpAAZ2lh7QWhX4kY65Uf_q0yK9FtHmW/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p)
- [**Lab:** Customized Data Visualization in `ggplot2`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/eds221-day8-comp/data_viz.html)

There are lots of other great data viz resources out there as well. Check out:

- [A ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R
](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/), by [CÃ©dric Scherer](https://www.cedricscherer.com/): a super comprehensive `{ggplot2}` tutorial that also includes a bunch of awesome interactive data viz examples (leveraging existing JavaScript libraries)
- [Beautifully Annotated: Enhancing your ggplots with Text](https://www.cararthompson.com/talks/rl-cambridge-beautifully-annotated/), by [Cara Thompson](https://www.cararthompson.com/index.html): blogpost + workshop slides; honestly one of the best tutorials on annotating ggplots that I've ever come across 
- Search [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=typed_query) on Twitter to explore an endless supply of incredibly creative data visualizations -- *this is seriously such an great way to learn new plotting tools/approaches and find inspiration for your next plot!*
- [ggplot extensions](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): explore registered `ggplot2` extensions (though this list is not exhaustive)

There are a number of great online books as well, including: 

- [`ggplot2` Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/), by [Winston Chang](https://github.com/wch)
- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/), by [Claus O. Wilke](https://clauswilke.com/)
- [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://socviz.co/index.html#preface), by [Kieran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/)
