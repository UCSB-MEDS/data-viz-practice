`{ggplot2}` has, in many ways, become the de facto tool for data visualization in R. And with the *many* extension packages available, there's hardly a limit to what you can create. Building effective and visually-pleasing data visualizations is a skill that gets easier with practice, and following a somewhat structured workflow -- at least at the start -- can help you get there faster. This workshop covers one approach for doing so, though you'll find what works best for you with time.

Below, you'll find three different examples, beginning with an assessment of the raw data and ending with a completed visualization. Here's a sneak peak of what we'll be creating:

## **`r fontawesome::fa("temperature-quarter", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Example 1:** Ocean Temperatures

```{r}

#..........................load packages.........................
library(tidyverse)
library(ggridges)

#..........................read in data..........................
mko_clean <- readRDS(here::here("clean-data", "mohawk_temps.rds"))

#.......................calculate avg temp.......................

  # create ridgeline plot ----
  ggplot(aes(x = Temp_bot, y = month_name, fill = after_stat(x))) +
  ggridges::geom_density_ridges_gradient(rel_min_height = 0.01, scale = 3) + # rel_min_height cuts trailing tails (0.01 suggested); scale sets extent of overlap
  
  # add vertical line at avg temp + annotation
  geom_vline(xintercept = mko_avg, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") +
  annotate(geom = "segment", x = 18, y = "April", xend = mko_avg, yend = "May",
           arrow = arrow(length = unit(3, "mm"))) + # this is mostly just a bunch of manual fiddling until the arrow is placed where I want it
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 18, y = "April", label = paste0(" Avg Temp = ", mko_avg, "째C"), hjust = "left") + # same here

  # set x-axis breaks ----
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(9, 12, 15, 18, 21)) +
  
  # arrange months in reverse chronological order ----
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(month.name)) + 
  
  # fill color ----
  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("#2C5374","#778798", "#ADD8E6", "#EF8080", "#8B3A3A"), name = "Temp. (째C)") +
  
  # update labs & titles ----
  labs(x = "Bottom Temperature (째C)",
       title = "Bottom Temperatures at Mohawk Reef, Santa Barbara, CA",
       subtitle = "Temperatures (째C) aggregated by month from 2005 - 2022") +
  
  # apply theme ----
  ggridges::theme_ridges(font_size = 13, grid = TRUE) +
  
  # adjust theme options ----
  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )

mko_ridges_plot
