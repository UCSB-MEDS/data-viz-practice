`{ggplot2}` has, in many ways, become the de facto tool for data visualization in R. And with the *many* extension packages available, there's hardly a limit to what you can create. Building effective and visually-pleasing data visualizations is a skill that gets easier with practice, and following a somewhat structured workflow -- at least at the start -- can help you get there faster. This workshop covers one approach for doing so, though you'll find what works best for you with time.
